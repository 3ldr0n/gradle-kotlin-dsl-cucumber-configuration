# Gradle Kotlin DSL cucumber configuration

Example of how to configure cucumber using Gradle 5 with the Kotlin DSL.

## Why?

Almost all the content explaining how to configure cucumber with gradle 5 uses groovy as the language for the build scrip. As I'm using Kotlin for my new projects, I decided to create an example build for future projects, and hope to help someone.
